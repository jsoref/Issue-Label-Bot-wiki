## Goal

It is the reponsibility of @hamelsmu and @inc0 to provide a secure environment for this application.  As part of this goal, it is our policy to ensure all patches are installed.  

## Monitoring

The maintainers of this app will monitor security mailing lists, review vendor notifications and Web sites, and research specific public Web sites for the release of new patches. The maintainers will heavily rely on GitHub [security alerts](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) in order to resolve patches.

## Implementation

Upon receiving security or vulnerability alert, maintainers will make the necessary changes within **3 business days.**

## Auditing, assessment, and verification

Following the release and installation of patches, our staff will verify the successful installation of the patch and that there have been no adverse effects.
