## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of the policy is to establish the goals for the breach response process.  This document is intended for compliance for the [Incident response plan](https://developer.github.com/marketplace/getting-started/security-review-process/#incident-response-plan) on the GitHub Marketplace.

## 1.1 Background

This policy mandates that any individual who suspects that a theft, breach or
exposure of sensitive data has occurred must immediately provide a description of what
occurred via e-mail to [hamelsmu _at_ github _dot_ com] and [inc0 _at_ github _dot_ com] or by filing an issue in [this repo](https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/Issue-Label-Bot). This team will investigate all reported thefts, data breaches, and exposures. If theft, breach or exposure has occurred, the Information Security Administrator will follow the appropriate procedure in place.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all whom collect, access, maintain, distribute, process, protect,
store, use, transmit, dispose of data related to Issue-Label-Bot.

## 3.0 Policy of data removal.

Issue-Label-Bot only operates on public GitHub repositories in order to steer clear of sensitive data.  However, **at any time any user can request for any reason whatsoever that any data logged by the application be removed.**  At that time, our administrative staff will remove all data pertaining to that user, if exists.

**We will remove all data within 72 hours from request.**

## 4.0 Data Collected By Issue-Label-Bot

No user-specific authentication is stored or collected by Issue-Label-Bot.  The only information that is stored is:
- The titles and comments of issues that occur after installing the app.
- Reactions such as üëç and üëé made in the issue.

This data is only logged for repositories that are public at the time the issue is opened.
